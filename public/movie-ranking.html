<h1>My favourite movies of all time</h1>

<h2>And why I like them</h2>

<hr />


<h3>Spiderman 2</h3>
<p>I like this movie in particular because it´s about tecnology and<br /> 
   biology merged in just one thing. Despite the plot of the enemy <br />
   Dr. Oc, its amazing how Mechatronics can play a very important role <br/>
   now a days...I know its science Fiction, but hey!!, can you imagine <br />
   in a future something like that?...
</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Not only because, as said before, I loove science fiction, but also <br />
   because I loved the way the director pf the movie cathed all diferent <br />
   ways of theories and facts in a movie, Imagine having the oportunity <br/>
   to see a black hole, or being in space...(of course from a saftey place.)
</p>
<h3>Treasure Planet</h3>
<p>Since I was a Kid, I´ve allways being keen on space stuff, universe stuff <br />
   or even alien stuff. This movie was one of the first of science fiction <br />
   I´ve seen.
